== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Theme compatibility =
This plugin has been designed to work with themes that adhere to the Wordpress and Woocommerce coding guidelines and maintain the standard Woocommerce shop page architecture. The majority of Woocommerce themes are compliant with these requirements, so most likely annasta Filters will work on your site with no need for additional adjustments.
You are welcome to contact us if you feel that you need an advice or help with the plugin integration with your theme, but please keep in mind that in some cases only the theme author can fix an incompatibility originating from non-compliance with the above-mentioned requirements.

= Troubleshooting =
If you are facing a problem with the functioning of the annasta Filters, please take a minute to look through our [Troubleshoot Guide](https://annasta.net/plugins/annasta-woocommerce-product-filters/troubleshoot/) to see if the solution to your issue has already been described there.

Before contacting us for the resolution of your issue, we ask you to kindly follow these steps:
1. If there is a newer version of plugin available, perform an update to see if the issue has already been addressed.
2. Turn on the default Woocommerce theme (Storefront) and see if the problem disappears. If it does, it should mean that the problem lies in the plugin interaction with your theme. You can still contact us to see if we can come up with a fix, just let us know that the problem that you are facing is related to the plugin incompatibility with your theme. 
3. Try to disable other active plugins (except for the Woocommerce), one by one, to see if the problem is caused by a conflict with another plugin.
4. Contact us to describe the issue.

= Feature requests =
We do maintain the program of the new features introduction for the future plugin releases, so there is a chance that the functionality that you are seeking is already on that list. You can contact us to find out if the feature that you are interested in is scheduled to appear in the next releases.
